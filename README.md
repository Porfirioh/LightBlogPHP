Why would I use this?
=========
Honestly, it's great. It's simple, it's easy to intergrate into any website. Plus it's great for people who want to learn web design and practice it at the same time, how so? Well you have a stylesheet and you have to use your skills to build off of the things that we're already given to you.

Installation
=========

1. Firstly, you'll need to download the lightblog files, just click the 'Download Zip' on the side.
2. Next, upload the contents of the 'upload' folder in your web server and begin to open 'assets/config/config.php'.
3. Upload the 'blog.sql' into your database.
4. Edit your default theme, company name, title of the pages, base url, accounts, and database information.
5. Create an Disqus account, and create a chat: https://disqus.com/websites/
6. Go to 'viewpost.php' and edit the 'CHANGETHIS_TO_YOUR_USERNAME' on line 35 to your Disqus username/chat.
7. Finally you'll be able to blog and do whatever you want! Enjoy!

Disclaimer
=========
This isn't perfect. It was made by two guys who wanted some simple solution to a problem.
That's why I uploaded it into github so fellow others can help out in the development and work out some bugs/glitches/exploits.

Also, this was made for a community which happens to speak only Portuguese so I tried my best to translate it from Portuguese to English
